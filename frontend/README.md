# Team Popo's Frontend Web-based Application

## Things that belong here

* Entire frontend app, y'all decide how you want to structure it because you know best

## Notes

* Will have to modify requests to conform to the backend API eventually
* Low-priority: putting the app in a container so that we can run every part of our project with a **single** command (nice)
  * Jaleel can do this, it should not affect the existing source code in any way and you should still be able to run it as usual
* Extremely low-priority: being able to switch between a local and deployed infrastructure would be great

## Dependencies

* React
* ??? lol
