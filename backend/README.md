# Team Popo's Backend REST API

## Things that belong here

* Definition of the entire backend in `backend/src`
* Definition of the backend reverse proxy in `backend/proxy`
* Testing suite of API calls in `backend/test`
* All deployment files, scattered in `backend/src` and `backend/proxy`

## Notes

* Will work on the API first so that the frontend can get used to it early
* Watch out for Linux dependencies, if this becomes an issue then you should install Ubuntu on your device. This isn't difficult at all, can be done in a few minutes. Even then, you probably will never have to run the backend yourself.

## Dependencies

* Python 3.10
* Flask/Gunicorn
* SQLAlchemy
* Marshmallow
