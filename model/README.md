# Team Popo's Deep Learning Model for Parking Violations

## Things that belong here

* Definition of the entire model in `model/src`
* Training & validation datasets in `model/datasets`
* Exports of trained models in `model/exports`
* Main entrypoint for using the model through the command-line or in a deployed container

## Notes

* Check if Jaleel or Andrew can use UQ's Rangpur cluster for training and prediction
* Image prediction should not take a long time, but an optional extension could be to use a hosted HPC cluster instead of a local deployment

## Dependencies

* Python 3.10
* Miniconda 3
* TensorFlow GPU
